# My Basic Memory Game
<div align="center">As a start it was a great challenge for me to be able to do it, I really enjoyed creating something like this from scratch with my own hands I'm very excited and happy that everything went as I wanted every bit of code written and implemented was a good taste in my mouth. I am very happy with the final result. I know that I must improve the code and that there are or can be much easier ways to do it but so far I am happy with the result.</div> <br>
